## Running in OpenShift

This project uses the scripts found in [openshift-developer-tools](https://github.com/BCDevOps/openshift-developer-tools) to setup and maintain OpenShift environments (both local and hosted).  Refer to the [OpenShift Scripts](https://github.com/BCDevOps/openshift-developer-tools/blob/master/bin/README.md) documentation for details.

**These scripts are designed to be run on the command line (using Git Bash for example) in the root `openshift` directory of your project's source code.**

### Special Notes for Nonâ€“BC Government Production OpenShift Deployments

If you are not using the BC Government Pathfinder OpenShift instance, you may need to import image streams for RHEL Dotnet Core.  A file "imagestreams.json" has been provided in the "other-templates" folder that contains a definition for these image streams.

This does not apply if you are doing local testing with OpenShift Origin or Minishift; if you are using OpenShift Origin or Minishift, follow the instructions below for the use of Centos as a source image on a local build.

## Running in a Local OpenShift Cluster

At times running in a local cluster is a little different than running in the production cluster.

Differences can include:
* Resource settings.
* Available image runtimes.
* Source repositories (such as your development repo).
* Etc.

To target a different repo and branch, create a `settings.local.sh` file in your project's local `openshift` directory and override the GIT parameters, for example;
```
export GIT_URI="https://github.com/bcgov/pssg-psd-csa.git"
export GIT_REF="openshift-updates"
```

Then run the following command from the project's local `openshift` directory:
```
genParams.sh -l
```

**Git Bash Note**: Ensure that you do not have a linux "oc" binary on your path if using Git Bash on a Windows PC to run the scripts.  A windows "oc.exe" binary will work fine.

This will generate local settings files for all of the builds, deployments, and Jenkins pipelines.
The settings in these files will be specific to your local configuration and will be applied when you run the `genBuilds.sh` or `genDepls.sh` scripts with the `-l` switch.

### Important Local Configuration 

Before you deploy your local build configurations...

The application uses .Net 3.0 s2i images for the builds.

## Deploying Your Project

All of the commands listed in the following sections must be run from the root `openshift` directory of your project's source code.

### Before You Begin...

If you are updating an existing environment you will need to be conscious of retaining access to the existing data in the given environment.  User accounts, database names, and database credentials can all be affected.  The processes affecting them should be reviewed and understood before proceeding.

For example, the process of deploying and managing database credentials has changed.  The process has moved to using shared secrets that are mounted as environment variables, where previously they were provisioned as discrete environment variables in each component's environment.  Further, the new deployment process, by default, will create a random set of credentials for each deployment or update (a new set every time you run `genDepls.sh`).  Being that the credentials are shared, there is a single source and place that needs to be updated.  You simply need to ensure the credentials are updated to the values expected by the pre-configured environment if needed.

### Initialization

If you are working with a new set of OpenShift projects, or you have run a `oc delete all --all` to start over, run the `initOSProjects.sh` script, this will repair the cluster file system services (in the Pathfinder environment), and ensure the deployment environments have the correct permissions to deploy images from the tools project.

### Generating the Builds, Images and Pipelines in the Tools Project

Run the following script and follow the instructions:

```
genBuilds.sh
```

Note that the script will stop mid-way through.  Ensure builds are complete in the tools project.  See below for additional details regarding the mygovbc-captcha-service-pipeline.

All of the builds should start automatically as their dependencies are available, starting with builds with only docker image and source dependencies.

The process of deploying the Jenkins pipelines will automatically provision a Jenkins instance if one does not already exist.  This makes it easy to start fresh; you can simply delete the existing instance along with it's associated PVC, and fresh instances will be provisioned.

#### Special Consideration for mygovbc-captcha-service-pipeline

The pipeline for the CAPTCHA service builds the project and updates the dev tag to point to the latest image, then pauses and waits for confirmation before updating the test and prod tags.  Versions as recent as [v7.4.0](https://github.com/bcgov/MyGovBC-CAPTCHA-Service/releases/tag/v7.4.0) encounter an error when deploying test and prod if the ImageStream does not yet have a test or prod tag.  Before continuing to deploy test and prod for the first time, you should create these tags, which can be done via the command-line:

```
oc tag mygovbc-captcha-service:latest mygovbc-captcha-service:test
oc tag mygovbc-captcha-service:latest mygovbc-captcha-service:prod
```

If the mygovbc-captcha-service ImageStream already has test and prod tags, no action is required.

### Generate the Deployment Configurations and Deploy the Components

Run the following script for each of the environments and follow the instructions to deploy the application components:

```
genDepls.sh -e <environmentName/>
```

### Wire Up Your Jenkins Pipelines

When `genBuilds.sh` provisions the Jenkins pipelines, webhook URLs and secrets will be automatically generated for them.  They can be accessed on the pipeline's Configuration tab in OpenShift.  To trigger automated deployments upon pushing to the GitHub repo, open the repo's Settings page, navigate to the Webhooks section, and click **Add webhook**.

1. Copy and paste the pipeline's GitHub Webhook URL as the Payload URL (it comes complete with the secret)
2. Set the content type to **application/json**
3. Leave the secret empty
4. Select **Just the push event**
5. Check **Active**
6. Click **Add webhook**
